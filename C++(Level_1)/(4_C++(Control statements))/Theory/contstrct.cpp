/*
   There are three types of control structures:-
   1.Sequence structure.:Sequence control structure refers to the line-by-line execution by which statements are executed sequentially, in the same order in which they appear in the program. They might, for example, carry out a series of read or write operations, arithmetic operations, or assignments to variables.

   2.Selection sturcture.:Selection control structure involves decision-making using conditional statements like if, if-else, and switch. Iteration control structure allows repetition of code using loops, such as for, while, and do-while loops.

   3.loop sturcture.:We use such a control structure when we need to repeat a particular instruction or number of instructions multiple times. Moreover, there can be a condition until which the particular block of statements will execute.
