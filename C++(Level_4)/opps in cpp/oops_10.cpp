//* Problem with shallow copy:
//^ 1.Shared Memory: Both h1 and h2 share the same memory for name, so any change in one objectâ€™s name affects the other.
//^ 2.Potential Issues with Destruction: When h1 and h2 go out of scope, both will try to delete[] name. This leads to a double free error (because the same memory is freed twice), causing a crash or undefined behavior.

//* Non-pointer members like health and level are copied by value in both shallow and deep copies. Each object (h1 and h2) will have its own independent storage for health and level, so changing health in one object does not affect the other.Pointer members like name are where the shallow copy differs. In a shallow copy, both objects share the same memory for name. Therefore, changing the contents of name in one object will affect the other object, but this behavior does not apply to health or other primitive members.
